                A Journey to Programming

                <p className="about-content first-para m-0">
                Problem solving, artistry, and a devotion to perfection led me to a career in
                Software Engineering -- but after almost 4 years in the industry -- its the challenges, 
                continuous learning, creativity, and collaboration that I appreciate the most.  
                In that time, I have quickly grown to be a well rounded Full-Stack developer 
                ready to contribute at any stage of the SDLC. I am hard-working and truly dedicated
                to giving 100% to all that I do.

                <p className="about-content mt-4">
                As an accomplished Software Engineer with strong knowledge of microservices, AWS cloud
                infrastructure, and end-to-end development, I bring a unique blend of skills to any 
                development team. Starting as a Java Web API Developer and advancing through 3 years of 
                hands-on, practical experience in an agile environment, Iâ€™ve cultivated a deep 
                understanding of the full software lifecycle and a rich AWS toolkit.

                <p className="about-content mt-4">
                I have played a key role in transforming monolithic legacy services into agile, 
                cloud-based microservices, including event-driven architectures, batch-processors, 
                configuration-driven REST services, role-based accessibility, and more. I am versed 
                in the automation of complex deployment workflows, managing everything from database 
                scripts to CI/CD pipeline integrations. In my current role, I manage, troubleshoot, and 
                innovate on 2 highly dynamic ECS-based REST services with modular designs, serving live 
                production workloads via an Angular UI on S3 and supported by RDS Postgres, Oracle, and 
                DynamoDB configurations. Leveraging my AWS Certified Developer Associate credential, I 
                offer a commitment to stability, innovation, and cloud-native efficiency.

                While my technical skills are current, polished, and growing daily I lean on my 
                personality traits to be the best employee and colleague I can be. With the 
                experience gained from many years in the hospitality industry, I bring a great
                attitude and positivity to all aspects of my life. I pride myself on my abilities to 
                bring people together by loosening up the insecurities of those around me and forming 
                a teamwork mentality among all walks of life.

                I am looking for a position that will challenge my skills. I want to be pushed out of 
                my comfort zone and trusted to work my way out. -- In this ever changing landscape of 
                technologies I am always looking for new, streamlined approaches to common problems and
                eager to unbox, learn, and utilize them. -- I am motivated by personal growth and I want 
                to funnel that motivation into a long-term position on a great team. I will try, fail, 
                learn, and try again until I succeed.
